\## Review checklist



\- \[ ] No data leakage (no target or future information in features)

\- \[ ] Splits are fixed; preprocessing fit on training data only

\- \[ ] No hardcoded paths; runs on a teammate's machine

\- \[ ] Seeds set for shuffling, initialisation and sampling

\- \[ ] Metric computed the way the team reports it

\- \[ ] dvc push done before git push (if data or models changed)

\- \[ ] Notebook restarted and run top to bottom (if notebooks changed)

\- \[ ] Style and naming (linter passes)
